# Green-Wave-Speed-Guidance-on-Signalized-Road-Networks
In busy city streets, cars often wait a long time at
traffic lights and then start slowly again. People have tried using
green lights to help traffic flow better, but it doesnâ€™t always
let every car through without stopping. This study introduces a
new way for cars to keep moving through intersections without
stopping completely. It means cars can speed up faster after
crossing the intersection, saving time. This method is not only
good for reducing travel time for each car but also cheaper and
better for the environment. The paper explains how this new
method works and tests it using a computer program called
VISSIM to see if it really helps traffic
